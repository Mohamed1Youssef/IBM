SpaceX Launch Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the success or failure of SpaceX rocket launches based on historical launch data. The goal is to build a model that can predict launch outcomes using various classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.

Key Features
Data Collection: Historical data on SpaceX launches, including rocket type, launch site, payload mass, and launch outcomes.

Data Wrangling: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for machine learning.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights gained from the data using tools like SQL and Python libraries.

Model Building: Various machine learning models to predict launch success.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of models using techniques such as GridSearchCV.

Evaluation: Performance comparison of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
